function fuzzy_simplicial_set = fuzzy_simplicial_set(X, n_neighbors, metric, varargin)
%FUZZY_SIMPLICIAL_SET Given a set of data X, a neighborhood size, and a
% measure of distance compute the fuzzy simplicial set (here represented as
% a fuzzy graph in the form of a sparse matrix) associated to the data.
% This is done by locally approximating geodesic distance at each point,
% creating a fuzzy simplicial set for each such point, and then combining
% all the local fuzzy simplicial sets into a global one via a fuzzy union.
%
% fuzzy_simplicial_set = FUZZY_SIMPLICIAL_SET(X, n_neighbors, metric)
% 
% Parameters
% ----------
% X: array of size (n_samples, n_features)
%     The data to be modelled as a fuzzy simplicial set.
% 
% n_neighbors: double
%     The number of neighbors to use to approximate geodesic distance.
%     Larger numbers induce more global estimates of the manifold that can
%     miss finer detail, while smaller values will focus on fine manifold
%     structure to the detriment of the larger picture.
% 
% metric: string or function (optional, default 'euclidean')
%     The metric to use to compute distances in high dimensional space. If
%     a string is passed it must match a valid predefined metric. For now,
%     valid string metrics include:
%         * euclidean (or l2)
%         * manhattan (or l1)
%         * chebyshev (or linf)
%         * correlation
%         * cosine
%         * hamming
%         * jaccard
%         * mahalanobis
%         * minkowski
%         * seuclidean
% 
% knn_indices: array of size (n_samples, n_neighbors) (optional)
%     If the k-nearest neighbors of each point has already been calculated
%     you can pass them in here to save computation time. This should be
%     an array with the indices of the k-nearest neighbors as a row for
%     each data point.
% 
% knn_dists: array of size (n_samples, n_neighbors) (optional)
%     If the k-nearest neighbors of each point has already been calculated
%     you can pass them in here to save computation time. This should be
%     an array with the distances of the k-nearest neighbors as a row for
%     each data point.
% 
% set_op_mix_ratio: double (optional, default 1)
%     Interpolate between (fuzzy) union and intersection as the set
%     operation used to combine local fuzzy simplicial sets to obtain a
%     global fuzzy simplicial sets. Both fuzzy set operations use the
%     product t-norm. The value of this parameter should be between 0 and
%     1; a value of 1 will use a pure fuzzy union, while 0 will use a pure
%     fuzzy intersection.
% 
% local_connectivity: double (optional, default 1)
%     The local connectivity required -- i.e. the number of nearest
%     neighbors that should be assumed to be connected at a local level.
%     The higher this value the more connected the manifold becomes
%     locally. In practice this should be not more than the local intrinsic
%     dimension of the manifold.
% 
% umap is the umap instance
%
% Returns
% -------
% fuzzy_simplicial_set: sparse matrix of size (n_samples, n_samples)
%     A fuzzy simplicial set represented as a sparse matrix. The (i, j)
%     entry of the matrix represents the membership strength of the
%     1-simplex between the ith and jth sample points.
